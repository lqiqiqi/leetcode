# Q
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

Example 1:
```
Input: 11
Output: 3
Explanation: Integer 11 has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011 
Example 2:

Input: 128
Output: 1
Explanation: Integer 128 has binary representation 00000000000000000000000010000000
```

class Solution(object):
    def hammingWeight(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        a = str(bin(n))
        r = 0
        for i in a:
            if i == '1':
                r += 1
        return r
```

# Better Ans
每次检查一个bit
```
public static int hammingWeight(int n) {
	int ones = 0;
    	while(n!=0) {
    		ones = ones + (n & 1);
    		n = n>>>1;
    	}
    	return ones;
}
```
