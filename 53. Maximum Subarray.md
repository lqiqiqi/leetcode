# Q
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

Example:
```
Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

# Better Ans
```
for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i-1] > 0:
            nums[i] += nums[i-1]
    return max(nums)
```
```
public static int maxSubArray(int[] A) {
    int maxSoFar=A[0], maxEndingHere=A[0];
    for (int i=1;i<A.length;++i){
    	maxEndingHere= Math.max(maxEndingHere+A[i],A[i]);
    	# 这一行作用是记录在A[i]作为结束的SubArray的最大值
    	# 当A[i]比maxEndingHere+A[i]更大的时候
    	# A[i]作为一个新的记录maxEndinghHere的起点
    	maxSoFar=Math.max(maxSoFar, maxEndingHere);	
    	# maxSoFar则是记录从0到i-1中的最大值
    }
    return maxSoFar;
}
```

**Dynamic programming (DP)** is a general algorithm design technique for solving problems with overlapping sub-problems. This technique was invented by American mathematician “Richard Bellman” in 1950s. Key Idea. The key idea is to save answers of overlapping smaller sub-problems to avoid recomputation.
