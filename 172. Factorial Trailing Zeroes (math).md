# Q
Given an integer n, return the number of trailing zeroes in n!.

Example 1:
```
Input: 3
Output: 0
Explanation: 3! = 6, no trailing zero.
Example 2:

Input: 5
Output: 1
Explanation: 5! = 120, one trailing zero.
Note: Your solution should be in logarithmic time complexity.
```

# Better Ans
Because all trailing 0 is from factors 5 * 2.

But sometimes one number may have several 5 factors, for example, 25 have two 5 factors, 125 have three 5 factors. In the n! operation, factors 2 is always ample. So we just count how many 5 factors in all number from 1 to n.

O(log_5(n))
```
class Solution:
    def trailingZeroes(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        return 0 if n == 0 else n // 5 + self.trailingZeroes(n // 5)
```
