# Q
Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example: 
```
Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation: 
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
```

# My Ans
in操作在dict(Hash Table)中比list快很多，但dic占用更多内存

If you don't need to associate values, use sets.

## 使用list的版本
```
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        
        lyst = []
        while True:
            sum_ = 0
            for i in str(n):
                sum_ += int(i) ** 2
            if sum_ in lyst:
                break
            n = sum_
            lyst.append(n)
            print(lyst)
        
        return True if n == 1 else False
```
## 使用dict的版本

class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: bool

        dic = {}
        while True:
            sum_ = 0
            for i in str(n):
                sum_ += int(i) ** 2
            if sum_ in dic:
                break
            n = sum_
            dic[n] = 1
            
        
        return True if n == 1 else False
