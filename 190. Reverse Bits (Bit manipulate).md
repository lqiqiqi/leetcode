#  Q
Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

Example:
```
Input: 43261596
Output: 964176192
Explanation: 43261596 represented in binary as 00000010100101000001111010011100, 
             return 964176192 represented in binary as 00111001011110000010100101000000.

# My Ans
```
class Solution:
    # @param n, an integer
    # @return an integer
    def reverseBits(self, n):
        a = bin(n)
        b = str(a)
        c = b[::-1][:-2]
        if len(c) < 32:
            c = c + (32 - len(c)) * '0'
        return int(c, 2)
```
# Better Ans
采用位运算更快些

Just generate the answer bit by bit, do not use things like "% 2" or "2 ** k" or "bin". Bit manipulation is a lot faster. One small thing is the plus operator can be replaced by "bitwise or", aka "|". However i found plus is more readable and fast in python.
```
def reverseBits(self, n):
    ans = 0
    for i in xrange(32):
        ans = (ans << 1) + (n & 1)
        n >>= 1
    return ans
```

Let's work on an example. Say, n = 19, which is 00000000000000000000000000010011 in binary, so in the output we should get 11001000000000000000000000000000 in binary, which is 3355443200.
We initialize answer to 0, so in binary it's 32 zeroes. We loop over 32 times, since every integer is gonna have 32 possible 0/1.
1st line in the loop: n & 1, we check if last bit of n is set, is it 1 or 0, ans << 1 we shift all bits that we already have in our answer to the left, so after this shifting the bit on the right is 0, + by using + we set the last bit in the answer to the value that we got in n & 1.
2nd line in the loop we shift bits of our initial number n to the right, since we've already checked the last bit of n, so we just move on to the next bit.

So, in our example, I'm gonna show only first 5 right bits, since other bits are 0.
answer = 0, in binary: 00000000000000000000000000000000
answer << 1 is 00000000000000000000000000000000, n & 1 is 00000000000000000000000000000001
after + operation answer is 00000000000000000000000000000001

answer = 1, in binary: 00000000000000000000000000000001
answer << 1 is 00000000000000000000000000000010, n & 1 is 00000000000000000000000000000001
after + operation answer is 00000000000000000000000000000011

answer = 3, in binary: 00000000000000000000000000000011
answer << 1 is 00000000000000000000000000000110, n & 1 is 00000000000000000000000000000000
after + operation answer is 00000000000000000000000000000110

answer = 6, in binary: 00000000000000000000000000000110
answer << 1 is 00000000000000000000000000001100, n & 1 is 00000000000000000000000000000000
after + operation answer is 00000000000000000000000000001100

answer = 12, in binary: 00000000000000000000000000001100
answer << 1 is 00000000000000000000000000011000, n & 1 is 00000000000000000000000000000001
after + operation answer is 00000000000000000000000000011001

And after that in our example, we'll just shift ** 00000000000000000000000000011001 all the way to the left, which is gonna lead to 11001000000000000000000000000000.

# Bitwise operator
按位运算符是把数字看作二进制来进行计算的。
1. & 按位与运算符：参与运算的两个值,如果两个相应位都为1,则该位的结果为1,否则为0
```
19 & 1
1

4 & 1
0
```

2. << 左移动运算符：运算数的各二进位全部左移若干位，由 << 右边的数字指定了移动的位数，高位丢弃，低位补0。
