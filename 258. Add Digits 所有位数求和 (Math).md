# Q
Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.

Example:
```
Input: 38
Output: 2 
Explanation: The process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. 
             Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
```             
Follow up:
Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?
# My Ans
class Solution:
    def addDigits(self, num):
        """
        :type num: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        res = sum(int(i) for i in str(num))
        while (res > 9):
            res = sum(int(i) for i in str(res))
        
        return res
```
# Better Ans
N=(a[0] * 1 + a[1] * 10 + ...a[n] * 10 ^n),and a[0]...a[n] are all between [0,9]

we set M = a[0] + a[1] + ..a[n]

and another truth is that:

1 % 9 = 1

10 % 9 = 1

100 % 9 = 1

so N % 9 = a[0] + a[1] + ..a[n]

```
def addDigits(self, num):
    """
    :type num: int
    :rtype: int
    """
    if num == 0 : return 0
    else:return (num - 1) % 9 + 1
```
