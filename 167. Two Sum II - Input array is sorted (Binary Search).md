# Q
Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

Note:

Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.
Example:
```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
```

class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, numbers, target):
        """
        :type numbers: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        for i in range(len(numbers)):
            temp = target - numbers[i]
            left = 0
            right = len(numbers) - 1
            while left <= right:
                mid = (left + right) // 2
                if temp < numbers[mid]:
                    right = mid - 1
                elif temp > numbers[mid]:
                    left = mid + 1
                else:
                    if mid == i:
                        a = [i+1, mid +2] #因为assume一定有solution，当i的时候如果mid==i，那一定是两个相同的数连着4+4=8
                        print(i+1, mid+2)
                        return a
                    a = [i+1, mid +1]
                    return a
