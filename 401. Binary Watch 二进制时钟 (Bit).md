A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top which represent the **hours** (**0-11**), and the 6 LEDs on the bottom represent the **minutes** (**0-59**).

Each LED represents a zero or one, with the least significant bit on the right.

For example, the above binary watch reads "3:25".

Given a non-negative integer *n* *which represents the number of LEDs that are currently on*, return all possible times the watch could represent.

**Example:**

```
Input: n = 1
Return: ["1:00", "2:00", "4:00", "8:00", "0:01", "0:02", "0:04", "0:08", "0:16", "0:32"]
```



**Note:**

- The order of output does not matter.
- The hour must not contain a leading zero, for example "01:00" is not valid, it should be "1:00".
- The minute must be consist of two digits and may contain a leading zero, for example "10:2" is not valid, it should be "10:02".

# My Ans

二进制时钟上每一个灯表示的数字对应的二进制数都只有一位为1

8 = 1000(b)

4 = 100(b)

2 = 10(b)

1 = 1(b)

1的个数 = 亮灯个数

```
