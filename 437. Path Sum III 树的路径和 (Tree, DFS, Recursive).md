You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value.

Find the number of paths that sum to a given value.

The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

The tree has no more than 1,000 nodes and the values are in the range -1,000,000 to 1,000,000.

**Example:**

```
root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], sum = 8

      10
     /  \
    5   -3
   / \    \
  3   2   11
 / \   \
3  -2   1

Return 3. The paths that sum to 8 are:

1.  5 -> 3
2.  5 -> 2 -> 1
3. -3 -> 11
```

# Definition for a binary tree node.

    def pathSum(self, root: TreeNode, sum: int) -> int:

        self.cache = {0:1}
        
        self.dfs(root, sum, 0, self.cache)
        
        return self.result
    
    def dfs(self, root, target, currPathSum, cache):
        if root is None:
            return
        
        currPathSum += root.val
        oldPathSum = currPathSum - target
        
        self.result += cache.get(oldPathSum, 0)
        cache[currPathSum] = cache.get(currPathSum, 0) + 1
        
        self.dfs(root.left, target, currPathSum, cache)
        self.dfs(root.right, target, currPathSum, cache)
        
        # 回退到上一层，currPathSum就不能用了
        cache[currPathSum] -= 1
```
