# Q
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

```
Given binary search tree:  root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]

        _______6______
       /              \
    ___2__          ___8__
   /      \        /      \
   0      _4       7       9
         /  \
         3   5
```
Example 1:
```
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
Example 2:

Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself 
             according to the LCA definition.
```
Note:

All of the nodes' values will be unique.
p and q are different and both values will exist in the BST.


# Better Ans
因为这是二叉搜索树，当p和q同时小于root或者大于root时，说明应该在subtree里面。如果不同时大于或者小于，说明当前root是中间位置且同时以p和q为子孙。

Just walk down from the whole tree's root as long as both p and q are in the same subtree (meaning their values are both smaller or both larger than root's). 
```
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root, p, q):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :type p: TreeNode
        :type q: TreeNode
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        if p.val < root.val > q.val:
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        if p.val > root.val < q.val:
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
        
        return root
```
